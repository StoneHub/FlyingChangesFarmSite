# FlyingChangesFarm.net

Website and digital hub for Flying Changes Farm in Marietta, South Carolina.

## Project Overview

FlyingChangesFarm.net is evolving from a simple static page into a full showcase for the farm, paramotor activity, primitive camping, and software projects based at 438 Pumpkintown Road. The site is deployed on Firebase Hosting (`flyingchangesfarm.net`) from the GitHub repository `StoneHub/FlyingChangesFarmSite`.

### Objectives

1. Deliver a lightweight, mobile-friendly landing experience rooted in verified info.
2. Host farm, hangar, and campsite media with placeholder embeds until official footage is ready.
3. Highlight primitive camping, herd care, and Pinnacle Paramotor with accurate CTAs.
4. Surface live GitHub activity (PickMyRoute, Care Calendar) instead of static app blurbs.
5. Prepare for future dynamic features (Hipcamp booking integration, Firebase-powered forms).

## Current Stack

- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting (auto-deployed via GitHub Actions)
- **Domain:** `flyingchangesfarm.net` (DNS managed via Bluehost)
- **Tech:** Static HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript
